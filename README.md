# LicenceAid
LicenceAid is a platform that comes to the aid of graduating students who are faced with something new to them - the state of the art. To do this, they must do extensive research to find information that helps them write their licenses. The requests for such an application are as follows:

• The platform must have different roles, with the possibility of a corresponding login for each: teacher, student, admin;

• Students can connect (login) / disconnect (logout) / recover the password, update the profile (name, image, hobbies, specialization etc.), see all the available materials, search by some criteria in the list (keywords), consult the materials, build their own lists of materials, put a status in a material of its own list (read / unread, useful / not useful), receive recommendations of materials to add in a particular list. Based on the history of the research, the system may recommend scientific papers with similar themes and ask the user if they want to add them to one of its lists. In addition, the student must be notified if his coordinating teacher has suggested that he read an article / material and accept / reject it.

• The coordinating professors can connect (login) / disconnect (logout) / recover the password, update the profile (name, image, specialization, field of interest etc.), add / delete students only they coordinate, recommend scientific articles to students

• The administrator can connect (login) / disconnect (logout). He can also add / edit / delete materials in the database, create / delete accounts for students or teachers (id, email, password)
